As eveerybody knows there is a gender wage gap not only in my country but also globally there might be numerous reasons for that, but one resone is their performance under pressure which might be time or other factors whoc can handel stressfull situation better for example. A successful manager have to increse copetetvie environment in their workplace to increase productivity, therefore, nowadays economist work on the data of profesional players like tennis players data. Chees is the only game that both gender can competitve in a fair invironment that chance does not play any role. As Fide record the data of game player an collect them in three differen categories: standard, rapid, and blitz which the only difference is the time constrant. Exactly like high position which women's number are lower than male when I have work with fide data only 10 percent of our players were women. previously It has been mentioned that the performance of femals decrease by increasing time limits (Dilmaghani.M 2019), but after covid-19 there were more pressure on the females than males becauses it has been mentioned that the sectors which loos their job was mostly the place that highering females or there is an expectation that women have to take care of the elder person ofthe family or after closing scholls women have to take care of their child(Alen et all 2020). Therefore Covid-19 act as a shock and we can use it as a dummy-variable in our model to see do women performe less than men after covid-19 by experiencing a more stressful situartion.

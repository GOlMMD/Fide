As it shown, and to be perfectly honest I had not lose any profetional game against females. My orst result was draw, also I win against femal with Zareolvares, Mohadeseh(Femal) with 1778 ELO rating, but lose against Aliasgari, Mohammad(Male) with only 1593 
ELO rating. ELO rating is how Fide sort their players the more ELO rating you have the better player you are. Plus, 200 difference is significant number therefore I might only win a game against better chessplayer because she was a femal.
I gussed I am the only man who performed better against femail, However, (Parsemon, D 2023) showed males perrformed better against femals they usually quite a game later even if they had a blunder(significant mistake which usually chess player resign sooner than the end of the game). Also, Gerdes and Gr√§nsmark (2010) showed women are risk averse by cheking the game theory of player opening. Therefore, I was not an exceptoin. 
As eveerybody knows there is a gender wage gap not only in my country but also globally there might be numerous reasons for that, but one resone is their performance under pressure which might be time or other factors whoc can handel stressfull situation better for example. A successful manager have to increse copetetvie environment in their workplace to increase productivity, therefore, nowadays economist work on the data of profesional players like tennis players data. Chees is the only game that both gender can competitve in a fair invironment that chance does not play any role. As Fide record the data of game player an collect them in three differen categories: standard, rapid, and blitz which the only difference is the time constrant. Exactly like high position which women's number are lower than male when I have work with fide data only 10 percent of our players were women. previously It has been mentioned that the performance of femals decrease by increasing time limits (Dilmaghani.M 2019), but after covid-19 there were more pressure on the females than males becauses it has been mentioned that the sectors which loos their job was mostly the place that highering females or there is an expectation that women have to take care of the elder person ofthe family or after closing scholls women have to take care of their child(Alen et all 2020). Therefore Covid-19 act as a shock and we can use it as a dummy-variable in our model to see do women performe less than men after covid-19 by experiencing a more stressful situartion.    
In this code I had tried to scrape the Fide data of chess players.
In the main part of the code it simply try to fide the Id numbers from player.txt then scrap the data of each player by aisync method put them in the excel folder and omit them from the all players.
